The Sovol SV01 (was) a nice little machine, but the time has come to upgrade it to Klipper to hopefully increase print quality and speed.
My machine is stock apart from two upgrades:

### All metal hot end
I installed a TriangleLabs V6 plated copper hot end following [this](https://youtu.be/IrHVTM04Ivc?si=vAyz9BuilHrvBVQR) great tutorial, which now allows me to print up to 290C. (or 500C with a thermistor swap according to the manufacturer)

### Auto bed leveling
I installed a cr touch, which was the best cheap upgrade I did.

## Klipper
I am installing klipper on a raspberry pi 3B+.
